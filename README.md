## Overview

**Muajjin** is a lightweight, privacy-friendly Islamic prayer times app built with modern web technologies and packaged as a native Android application using Capacitor.

Prayer times are calculated locally on the device—no tracking, no remote APIs required.

## Philosophy

This app is designed with a **minimal feature philosophy**. The focus is intentionally narrow:

- ✅ Prayer times
- ✅ Fasting times (Suhoor/Iftar)

Any additional features beyond these core functions will **not** be implemented. The goal is to keep the app simple, lightweight, and focused on its essential purpose.

- 🌙 Suhoor and Iftar times for Ramadan  
- 📅 Hijri date display  
- 🎨 Automatic light and dark theme support  
- 📱 Native Android app via Capacitor
